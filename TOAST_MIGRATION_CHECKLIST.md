8. **Testing**
   - [ ] Add unit tests for toast service
   - [ ] Add integration tests for toast hooks
   - [ ] Add E2E tests for notification flows

## üîß Migration Commands

### Quick Migration for Components
```typescript
// Old way
import { useNotification } from '../contexts/NotificationContext'
const { showSuccess, showError } = useNotification()
showSuccess('Success message')

// New way (backward compatible)
import { useToast } from '../hooks/useToast'
const toast = useToast()
toast.success('Success message')

// Or keep using context (now uses React-Toastify internally)
const { showSuccess, showError } = useNotification()
showSuccess('Success message') // Now uses React-Toastify
```

### Quick Migration for Services
```typescript
// Old way
import { notificationService } from '../services/notification.service'
notificationService.showSuccess('Message')

// New way
import { toastService } from '../services/toast.service'
toastService.success('Message')

// Or use convenience import
import { toast } from '../utils/toast'
toast.success('Message')
```

### Promise-based Operations
```typescript
// Replace manual loading states
const handleOperation = async () => {
  setLoading(true)
  try {
    await operation()
    showSuccess('Success')
  } catch (error) {
    showError('Failed')
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}

// With promise toast
const handleOperation = () => {
  toast.promise(
    operation(),
    {
      pending: 'Processing...',
      success: 'Success!',
      error: 'Failed!'
    }
  )
}
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Toasts not appearing
**Solution:** Check that ToastContainer is added to main.tsx and CSS is imported

### Issue 2: Styling not applied
**Solution:** Ensure toast.css is imported after ReactToastify.css

### Issue 3: Actions not working
**Solution:** Use useCustomToast hook for toasts with actions instead of basic toastService

### Issue 4: Mobile layout issues
**Solution:** CSS media queries are included, check viewport meta tag

### Issue 5: TypeScript errors
**Solution:** 
- Use `useCustomToast()` for complex toasts with actions
- Use `useToast()` for simple text toasts
- Check autoClose type (number | false, not boolean)

### Issue 6: JSX in service files
**Solution:** Services use simple text formatting. For complex content, use `useCustomToast()` hook in components

## üìù Notes

### Migration Strategy
1. **Gradual Migration** - Update components one by one
2. **Backward Compatibility** - Keep old APIs working during transition
3. **Testing First** - Test each component after migration
4. **Documentation** - Update docs as we go

### Best Practices Established
1. Use `useToast()` hook for new components
2. Use `toast.promise()` for async operations
3. Use convenience methods (`toast.saveSuccess()`) when possible
4. Add actions for critical errors
5. Use persistent toasts for server errors

### Lessons Learned
1. React-Toastify provides much better UX than Material-UI Snackbar
2. Promise-based toasts eliminate boilerplate code
3. Custom CSS allows perfect brand integration
4. Migration utilities help maintain compatibility
5. Comprehensive typing improves developer experience
