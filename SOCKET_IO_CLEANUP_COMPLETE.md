- ❌ Removed "Socket Connected/Disconnected" status chip
- ❌ Removed "Debug Status" button
- ❌ Removed debug info alert panel
- ✅ Kept "Live Updates" chip when socket is connected
- ✅ Kept "Refresh" button

### 2. useSocket.ts
- ❌ Removed detailed connection state change logging
- ❌ Removed auto-connect debug logs
- ❌ Removed verbose connection/disconnection logs
- ✅ Kept essential error logging for failures

### 3. socket.service.ts
- ❌ Removed verbose connection success logging
- ❌ Removed detailed isConnected debug info
- ❌ Removed "Initializing Socket.IO client" logs
- ❌ Removed detailed join/leave room logs
- ✅ Kept essential connection/disconnection logs
- ✅ Kept error logging for troubleshooting

### 4. useWorkflowRuns.ts
- ❌ Removed all console.log statements for connection events
- ❌ Removed verbose auto-connect logs
- ❌ Removed detailed execution room join logs
- ✅ Kept core functionality intact

### 5. Deleted Debug Files
- ❌ `src/test-socketio-import.js`
- ❌ `src/test-socket-connection.js`
- ❌ `src/components/debug/SocketDebug.tsx`
- ❌ Debug route `/debug/socket`
- ❌ All debug documentation files

## ✅ Clean Production Code

### Current Features
- **Auto-connect**: Socket automatically connects when components mount
- **Live Updates**: Shows "Live Updates" chip when socket is connected
- **Room Management**: Automatically joins execution/content rooms
- **Error Handling**: Essential error logging for troubleshooting
- **Fallback Polling**: Falls back to API polling when socket disconnected

### User Experience
- **Clean UI**: No debug information cluttering the interface
- **Live Indicator**: Users see "Live Updates" when real-time is active
- **Seamless**: Socket connection happens transparently
- **Reliable**: Fallback mechanisms ensure app works without socket

### Minimal Logging
Only essential logs remain:
- ✅ `Socket.IO connected: <socket-id>`
- ✅ `Socket.IO disconnected: <reason>`
- ✅ Error logs for connection failures
- ✅ Warnings for room join failures

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The Socket.IO implementation is now clean and production-ready:

1. **No Debug Clutter**: All debug code and files removed
2. **Clean UI**: Professional interface without debug panels
3. **Essential Logging**: Only necessary logs for troubleshooting
4. **Optimal Performance**: No unnecessary console output
5. **User-Friendly**: Clear "Live Updates" indicator

### Testing
- Visit `/workflows` - should show clean interface
- Socket connects automatically in background
- "Live Updates" chip appears when connected
- Real-time updates work seamlessly
- No debug logs cluttering console

The Socket.IO integration is complete and ready for production use!
